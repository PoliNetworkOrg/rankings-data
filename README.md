# rankings-dati

This repo contains scraped and parsed data of Polimi rankings.
Over the years, various scripts and backup methods have been used, 
so the repo is initialized with the data available in 2025 using 
[rankings-backend-go](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/rankings-backend-go) as a scraper/parser.

L'attuale webapp per visualizzare i dati si trova nella repo [Rankings](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/Rankings)
che ha deployment prod su https://rankings.polinetwork.org
